Let's solve together this [mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) though SQL?

Fisrt of all, I'll paste herethe initial flavor text:

> A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.
